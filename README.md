## Overview
### Description
What is art? What entitles a piece to be displayed in a museum? If a new painting is introduced in a museum, do we all take it as art for granted? We want to take this message further, right into our buying and selling. 

Whether you're currently enrolled in the Art Institute of No Man's Land, or Cooper Union, you're on our ship to hunt for treasure. 
<!--You name a desirable sell price. Our algorithm creates a range of price levels based on fibonacci retracement ratios (61.8, or 76.4). Anytime a buyer bids a price into that range, you get an alert. -->

Cassiopeia empowers art students to convert portfolio works into monetary value. As a global city, New York is home to some of the top art schools in the country. It's dispiriting that art students endure financial hardships when art is power. As a platform, we encourage artists to fire up their imagination and create pieces that are true to their heart.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Art / E-commerce
- **Mobile:** iOS
- **Story:** Allow users to upload their art works in which buyers can access it to make an offer if they like the arts
- **Market:** Students, Buyers like homeowners
- **Habit:** Users have unlimited upload during a day but their posts have to be an art works. Artists will upload works when they complete them, we cannot give a time constraint on art, but are hoping that users will use the app on at least a weekly basis
- **Scope:** The app will start off with artists being able to upload their artwork that buyers can express interest in purchasing. The app may then be expanded to include bidding options and the creation of a community of artists and buyers where artists can be followed and artwork can be commented on.
